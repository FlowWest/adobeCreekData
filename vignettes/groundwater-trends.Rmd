## Introduction 

In this article I explore groundwater elevation trends, we are mostly interested
in elevation difference across 10 years, 5 years and recent year. We also only look 
at groundwater wells where data was reported recently (2018). The comparison will
focus on the elevation for Fall values (August-November).


## Groundwater Well Selection 

We will focus on wells where a groundwater elevation was reported for 2018. 

```{r}
groundwater_stations %>% 
  filter(year(end_date) >= 2018)
```
