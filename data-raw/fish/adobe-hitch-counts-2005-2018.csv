Adobe,bell_hill_rd,2017-02-26,NA,Lowrie,"The last two days the osprey have been
taking fish from Adobe Creek above and below Bell Hill Crossing. The
fish are about 10"" with a sharp dorsal fin, rather like a shark. They
looked more silver than the gold hue I see on the carp but the distance
was too far to be sure."
Adobe,merrit_rd,2017-02-14,0,Windrem,"about 20 Sacramento suckers: it seemed they
were working their way upstream and were being replaced by others. The
water is still murky, so visibility was impaired. They were actively
spawning. An one point, a cloud of eggs and sperm boiled up from where
they were swirling about and floated downstream.They are
beautiful fish during the spawning run. Their golden sides with the
dark reddish stripe from nose to tail are dramatic. I've not seen a
photograph of them anywhere that does justice to their beauty during
this time. There's a great opportunity for a nature photographer."
